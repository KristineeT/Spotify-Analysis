## Overview
This project analyzes a Spotify dataset using SQL, progressing from basic to advanced queries. It covers essential SQL skills, including aggregations, filtering, window functions, and Common Table Expressions (CTEs) to extract meaningful insights from streaming data.

```sql
-- create table
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spotify;
CREATE TABLE spotify (
    artist VARCHAR(255),
    track VARCHAR(255),
    album VARCHAR(255),
    album_type VARCHAR(50),
    danceability FLOAT,
    energy FLOAT,
    loudness FLOAT,
    speechiness FLOAT,
    acousticness FLOAT,
    instrumentalness FLOAT,
    liveness FLOAT,
    valence FLOAT,
    tempo FLOAT,
    duration_min FLOAT,
    title VARCHAR(255),
    channel VARCHAR(255),
    views FLOAT,
    likes BIGINT,
    comments BIGINT,
    licensed BOOLEAN,
    official_video BOOLEAN,
    stream BIGINT,
    energy_liveness FLOAT,
    most_played_on VARCHAR(50)
);
```
## Project Steps

### 1. Data Exploration
Before diving into SQL, itâ€™s important to understand the dataset thoroughly. The dataset contains attributes such as:
- `Artist`: The performer of the track.
- `Track`: The name of the song.
- `Album`: The album to which the track belongs.
- `Album_type`: The type of album (e.g., single or album).
- Various metrics such as `danceability`, `energy`, `loudness`, `tempo`, and more.

### 2. Querying the Data
After the data is inserted, various SQL queries can be written to explore and analyze the data. Queries are categorized into **easy**, **medium**, and **advanced** levels to help progressively develop SQL proficiency.

#### Easy Queries
- Simple data retrieval, filtering, and basic aggregations.
  
#### Medium Queries
- More complex queries involving grouping, aggregation functions, and joins.
  
#### Advanced Queries
- Nested subqueries, window functions, CTEs, and performance optimization.


## 15 DataDriven Questions

### Easy Level
1. Retrieve the names of all tracks that have more than 1 billion streams.
```sql
SELECT * FROM spotify
WHERE stream > 1000000000;
```

2. List all albums along with their respective artists.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT album, artist FROM spotify
ORDER BY 1;
```

3. Get the total number of comments for tracks where licensed = TRUE.
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT licensed FROM spotify

SELECT * FROM spotify
WHERE licensed = 'true'
SELECT SUM (comments) as total_comments FROM spotify
WHERE licensed = 'true';
```

4. Find all tracks that belong to the album type single.
```sql
SELECT * FROM spotify
WHERE album_type = 'single';
```

5. Count the total number of tracks by each artist.
```sql
SELECT 
artist,
COUNT (*) as total_number_of_songs
FROM spotify
GROUP BY artist
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```

### Medium Level
6. Calculate the average danceability of tracks in each album.
```sql
SELECT 
album,
avg(danceability) as avg_danceability
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```

7. Find the top 5 tracks with the highest energy values.
```sql
SELECT 
track,
MAX (energy)
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc
LIMIT 5;
```

8. List all tracks along with their views and likes where official_video = TRUE.
```sql
SELECT 
track,
SUM (views) as total_views,
SUM (likes) as total_likes
FROM spotify
WHERE official_video = 'true'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 desc;
```

9. For each album, calculate the total views of all associated tracks.
```sql
SELECT 
album,
track,
SUM(views)
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

10. Retrieve the track names that have been streamed on Spotify more than YouTube.
```sql
SELECT*FROM 
(SELECT 
track,
--most_played_on,
COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Youtube' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_youtube,
COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN most_played_on = 'Spotify' THEN stream END),0) as streamed_on_spotify
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)as t1
WHERE 
streamed_on_spotify > streamed_on_youtube
and  streamed_on_youtube <> 0;

SELECT track, artist
 FROM spotify
WHERE most_played_on = 'Spotify';
```

### Advanced Level
.11 Find the top 3 most-viewed tracks for each artist using window functions.
--each artists and total view for each track
--track with highest view for each artist (we need top 3)
--use dense rank and cte filter rank 3
```sql
WITH ranking_artist
AS
(SELECT
artist,
track,
SUM(views) as total_view,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY artist ORDER BY SUM (views) desc) as rank
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1,3 desc
)
SELECT * FROM ranking_artist
WHERE rank <= 3;
```

12. Write a query to find tracks where the liveness score is above the average.
```sql
SELECT
track,
artist,
liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE liveness > (SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify);

SELECT AVG(liveness) FROM spotify -- .19
```
13. Use a WITH clause to calculate the difference between the highest and lowest energy values for tracks in each album.
```sql
WITH cte
AS
(SELECT
album,
MAX(energy) as highest_energy,
MIN (energy) as lowest_energy
FROM spotify
GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
album,
highest_energy - lowest_energy as energy_diff
FROM cte
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```

14. Find tracks where the energy-to-liveness ratio is greater than 1.2.
```sql
SELECT 
track,
energy_liveness
FROM spotify
WHERE energy_liveness > 1.2;
```

15. Calculate the cumulative sum of likes for tracks ordered by the number of views, using window functions.
```sql
SELECT 
    track,
    views,
    likes,
    SUM(likes) OVER (PARTITION BY track ORDER BY views DESC) AS cumulative_likes
FROM spotify
ORDER BY track, views DESC;
```
